import SwiftUI

/// Focus on a single recipe in the app
/// - Allow the user to read and scroll through the recipe
/// - The user should be able to preview everything about the recipe like...
///     - the creation date
///     - times referenced (maybe a stretch goal)
///     - the ingredients as a list (could put preview images pulled from some
///       database) or just used icons
///         - Could also figure out how Apple auto-categorizes the grocery list
///           in Reminders
///     - the instruction for the recipe
/// - The user should be able to edit the recipe by clicking a button
/// - The user should be able to delete the recipe by click another button
/// - The should be able to share the recipe, which exports the recipe to...
///     - A plaintext formatted string
///     - JSON (I like this idea)
///     - Some weird proprietary format that I choose
