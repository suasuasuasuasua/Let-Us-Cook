## Overview

Let Us Cook is an app written for macOS that allows user to plan and budget
meals around a recipe system. This app was written for final project for the
Spring 2024 session of macOS development at the Colorado School of Mines.

The main motivation for this app is to give users a way to plan and budget meals
for each day. I find that I often overspend on fast food because I don't know
what I want to eat, or I just didn't plan far enough ahead to make food at home.
Now that I'm 22 (wow I'm 22), I think that it's time to start taking control of
my life by saving money and eating healthier, and I think that this app could
help other people with the same problem as me.

Life happens sometimes. You might not able to eat the meal you planned, you can
always save the recipe for another day. This app is designed to be flexible and
easy-to-use. You can just fill in what you did eat for that day and move on.

## Features

### Fundamental

These features define the core of the app.

- [x] The user will also be able to add, edit, and delete recipes.
  - [x] The user will be able to search for recipes by name.
  - [ ] Add a drag-and-drop feature to add recipes to the calendar.
  - [x] The user will be able to visualize the recipes as templates.
- [x] The user can preview all the meals in a calendar view with the ability to
      fine-tune to the current day, week, and month.
- [ ] The user's calendar app will also be able to sync with the app to give you
      a visualization of what you plan to eat.
- [ ] The user's reminders app will be populated with the ingredients needed for
      the recipes.
- [ ] The user can subscribe to a recipe blog via RSS feed.
  - If you're a fan of a food blogger or just need some inspiration, you can
    subscribe to their blog which automatically create the recipes for you.

### Stretch

These features are nice-to-haves that would make the app more useful. Today
(March 28, 2024) I don't think I'll be able to implement all of these features
by the time that the final project is due (May 3, 2024). If anything, this
project could live on as a personal project that I can work on in my free time.

- [ ] The app should total up the cost of the ingredients for the week
  - Each recipe will have a cost associated with it which should be pulled
    from local grocery stores like Target (or maybe whatever is close-by?).
  - Perhaps the price could be compared with other stores to give the user the
    best deal.
- [ ] The app should calculate the amount of time that it would take to make the
      recipe.
- [ ] The app should calculate the macronutrients of the meal.
  - Ideally, we can track the amount of protein, fat, and carbohydrates in the
    meal based on the ingredients.
  - This would be useful for people who are more conscious about their diet.
- [ ] The app should track how many times the recipe was referenced (i.e. how
      many times the user has eaten this dish)
- [ ] The user can share recipes with other users.
- [ ] Create an iOS port
  - This would allow the user to view their recipes easier especially in the
    kitchen
- [ ] AI that can suggest recipes based on your preferences.
  - Just ask _"What should I eat today?"_
